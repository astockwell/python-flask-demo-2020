## Ideas
Run locally, or deploy to VM / Docker / K8s
Call local python functions
Use instead of mass email - token for each user
Code can use/build lookup table - direct reports for each user + access validation
Get back headers+host+os details

## Going to Production?
Threads/load balancing/deployment considerations
TLS
Auth/SSO
